# SMS-Alert
This is a software that helps sends an alert (ex. rain alert) as SMS using python code

RESOURCES NEEDED FOR THE APIs
====

1-- You'll need an account on Weather Map (go here https://openweathermap.org/) to get the api for the weather
2-- You'll need an account on Twilio (go here https://www.twilio.com/) to get the api for the sms 

===
The source code is available inside the main.py file with neccessary details and procedure. Ensure you read comments on each line.

It is as well recommended to read the documentation for each of the api you'll be sourcing

PS: The apis have both free and premium package. The choice is yours. 

Check the screenshot below (You'll be able to get rid of the 'sent from Twilio trial account' once you sign up for a premium account)
